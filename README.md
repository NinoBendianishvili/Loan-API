# Loan API

## Overview
The Loan API is a RESTful web service that enables users to apply for loans and manage their accounts while allowing accountants to review and control loan statuses. It follows best practices such as JWT authentication, role-based authorization, and proper exception handling.

## Features

### User Management
- **Register a user** (`POST /api/auth/register`)
- **User login** (`POST /api/auth/login`)
- **Get user details** (`GET /api/users/{id}`)
- **Role-based authorization**
  - `User`: Can apply for, view, update, and delete their own loans
  - `Accountant`: Can view, edit, and delete any loan, as well as block users from applying for loans

### Loan Management
- **Apply for a loan** (`POST /api/loans`)
- **View userâ€™s loans** (`GET /api/loans/user/{userId}`)
- **Update a loan (only if status is 'Processing')** (`PUT /api/loans/{loanId}`)
- **Delete a loan (only if status is 'Processing')** (`DELETE /api/loans/{loanId}`)
- **Accountants can update or delete any loan**
- **Accountants can block a user from applying for loans** (`PUT /api/users/block/{userId}`)

### Loan
| Field        | Type    | Description                          |
|-------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| `id`        | `GUID` | Unique identifier                   |

## Security
- **JWT-based authentication** (`Bearer Token` required for protected routes)
- **Role-based authorization** (`Accountant` vs `User`)
- **Password hashing** (stored securely using a hashing algorithm)

## Error Handling
- Returns proper HTTP status codes (`400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `500`)
- Uses structured error messages instead of exposing raw exceptions

## Database
- Normalized schema (Users and Loans are separate tables)
- Uses a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MSSQL)
- Logging stored in database (e.g., loan requests, user actions)
